# 🧠 Debate Engine

> A multi-agent epistemic reasoning system that researches both sides of any question using live web sources, structured belief graphs, and semantic contradiction detection.

Built with [thinkn.ai beliefs SDK](https://thinkn.ai/dev) + [Exa](https://exa.ai) + GPT-4o.

## What It Does

Traditional LLM research accumulates text. This system accumulates **understanding**.

Two opposing agents (`pro` and `anti`) independently research a question via live web search. Every piece of content they ingest is parsed into **typed, confidence-weighted belief nodes** in a shared namespace. The SDK automatically:

- Detects semantic contradictions across sources that never reference each other
- Suppresses the clarity score when genuine epistemic conflict exists
- Tracks open gaps and ranks the highest-value next research actions
- Fuses multi-agent outputs into a single coherent world state

A third **judge** agent reads the fused namespace and produces a structured, evidence-grounded verdict via GPT-4o.

## How It Works

### 1. Config Bootstrap
GPT-4o takes the user's question and generates the debate configuration:
- Two named sides (pro / anti) with distinct research angles
- A single overarching goal node
- 4 investigable gap nodes (things the system doesn't know yet)
- Seed search queries for round 1

### 2. Belief Agents — Shared Namespace
```ts
const proAgent  = new Beliefs({ apiKey, agent: 'pro',   namespace: ns })
const antiAgent = new Beliefs({ apiKey, agent: 'anti',  namespace: ns })
const judge     = new Beliefs({ apiKey, agent: 'judge', namespace: ns })

// All three agents write to and read from the same belief graph.
// The SDK fuses their outputs — no manual diffing needed.
```

### 3. The Round Loop
Each round:
1. `judge.read()` — snapshot the full world state
2. `debateDirector()` — GPT-4o reads `world.moves[]` (ranked by expected information gain) and writes Exa queries
3. Both agents run Exa searches in parallel
4. Each result page is fed into `agent.after(webContent)` — the SDK extracts beliefs, scores confidence, detects contradictions
5. Resolved gaps are closed with `beliefs.resolve(gap)`
6. State is streamed to the UI via SSE

### 4. Early Exit
The runner exits when the SDK signals diminishing returns:
```ts
const shouldStop =
  world.moves.length === 0          ||  // no further high-value actions
  topMove.value < 0.1               ||  // expected information gain near zero
  (world.gaps.length === 0 &&
   world.contradictions.length >= CONTRADICTION_THRESHOLD)
```

### 5. Judge Verdict
```ts
const context = await judge.before()   // structured belief-graph briefing
// context.prompt is injected into GPT-4o as system prompt
// The LLM summarises the belief graph, not the raw web
```

## SDK Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `new Beliefs({ agent, namespace })` | Three agents sharing one namespace |
| `beliefs.add([...], { type: 'gap' })` | Seed 4 investigable unknowns |
| `beliefs.add({ type: 'goal' })` | Set the debate objective |
| `beliefs.after(webContent)` | Extract + fuse beliefs from Exa page text |
| `beliefs.read()` | Full world state: beliefs, gaps, contradictions, moves |
| `beliefs.before()` | Structured system prompt for GPT-4o verdict |
| `beliefs.resolve(gap)` | Explicitly close a gap answered by evidence |
| `beliefs.snapshot()` | Lightweight state read for UI polling |

## The Clarity Score

Clarity is **not** a quality score — it's epistemic readiness, computed across four channels:

$$\text{clarity} = f(\underbrace{\text{decisionResolution}}_{\text{goals met}},\ \underbrace{\text{knowledgeCertainty}}_{\text{high-confidence beliefs}},\ \underbrace{\text{coherence}}_{\text{low contradictions}},\ \underbrace{\text{coverage}}_{\text{gaps closed}})$$

> A clarity of `0.41` after 53 ingested sources is **correct behavior** — on a genuinely contested topic, the `coherence` channel stays suppressed. The system knows it doesn't know.

## UI Walkthrough

### Header — Scorecard
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Total beliefs` | All claim nodes in the fused namespace |
| `Established >0.70` | High-confidence, consistent beliefs |
| `Contested 0.40–0.70` | Disputed or partially supported |
| `Weak <0.40` | Low signal — single source or contradicted |
| `Contradictions` | Semantic conflicts detected across sources |
| `Open gaps` | Unknowns still unresolved |
| `Gaps resolved` | Gaps explicitly closed via `beliefs.resolve()` |
| `Judge clarity` | Overall epistemic readiness (0–1) |
| `Sources ingested` | Total Exa pages fed via `after()` |

### Round Cards
- **Director line** (cyan italic) — GPT-4o's reasoning from `world.moves[]`
- **Next-round value** — SDK's expected information gain for the next round
- **Source list** — Exa pages fed into `beliefs.after()`
- **⚡ Conflicts badge** — contradictions detected in this round
- **WHAT CONFLICTED** — the specific belief pairs that semantically negate each other
- **Clarity bars** — per-agent clarity after round completion
- **Resolved chip** (green) — gap closed this round via `beliefs.resolve()`

### GPT-4o Verdict
Verdict sections map directly to belief graph confidence tiers — the structure comes from the SDK, not prompt engineering:

| Verdict Section | Belief Tier |
|----------------|-------------|
| Evidence clearly supports | Established `> 0.70` |
| Actively contested | Contested `0.40–0.70` |
| Genuinely unknown | Open gaps |
